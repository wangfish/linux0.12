2005-06-13: Include sources for Linux 0.11 and Redhat 9 systems. 
	    Sources simplified.

2005-01-20: This version is built under RedHat 9.

I built it under Linux 0.11. Just for fun and for learning something.
Two tasks multtasking in level 3, but they are coded in 'kernel' code
same as Linux kernel's task0 & task1. It has got one system call to 
display character.

The source has no or little comments, SORRY! If you want to understand
what the hell they are meant, please look into the kernel 0.11 source
code.
